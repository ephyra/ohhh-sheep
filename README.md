# ohhh-sheep

Done in unity 2020.3.46f1 for android devices.

Basic ohh sheep gameplay functionalities and skills.

Features not implemented/potential future add-ons:
-Sounds: should add BGM, click sound for tiles and skills, tile destruction sound when user matches 3, victory and defeat sounds.
-Retry current stage function (restart generates new level instead): Probably best done by storing JSON file of generated layers, tiles and it's quadrants covered and tiles covered information.
