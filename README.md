# ohhh sheep(羊了个羊）game

Done in unity 2020.3.46f1 for android devices, contains basic ohh sheep gameplay functionalities and skills.

### Running the project
Ensure you have unity 2020.3.46f1 installed and clone repo then Add project to unity hub and open.

### Building new apk

### Running the game
Download and install your built apk or prebuilt apk in the repo onto android device and run ohh sheep app.

### Features not implemented/potential future add-ons:
- Sounds: should add BGM, click sound for tiles and skills, tile destruction sound when user matches 3, victory and defeat sounds.

- Retry current stage function (restart generates new level instead): Probably best done by storing JSON file of generated layers, tiles and it's quadrants covered and tiles covered information.
